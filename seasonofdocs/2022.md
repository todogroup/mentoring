## About TODO Group

TODO is a open community of practitioners who aims to create and share knowledge about Open Source Program Offices or similar Open Source initiatives.
TODO Group has created useful open source tooling, reaseach studies and guides to help open source program office adoption within organizations since 2012.
Since then, the contributor community has been gowing that demands the need for more detailed contirbutions guidelines, and update some of the TODO resources 
to be alligned with the most recent OSPO trends.

TODO resources are open to everyone and available at TODO Group GitHub repo under CC-BY 4.0 Licence (content) and Apache 2.0 (tooling)

## todogorup.org Project

todogroup.org repo houses the assets used to build the website for the TODO Group at https://todogroup.org.

**ðŸ¤” Problem**

TODO contributor community has been gowing within the last years (with global contributors from APAC, EMEA and AMER timezone). This demands the need of more detailed contribution guidelines 
for each of the different TODO resources, as well as have updated information from the existing TODO Guides. 

The existing TODO contribution guidelines are stored in the todogroup.org repo as `.md` files and in th [README file](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org#-adding-resources).

**ðŸŽ¯ Scope**

There are two goals TODO Group aims to achieve:

* `GOAL 1` Update TODO OSPO Guides: some of the TODO guides need to be updated to be alligned with the most recent OSPO trends
* `GOAL 2`  Create new and improve existing contirbution Guidelines for TODO resources

For `GOAL 1`, TODO Group will:

* Audit the existing documentation and create a `mind map` of the current documentation for the top TODO guides to organize information (getting started, legal, community, strategy, structure, policies)
* Use the `mind map` as a guide for understanding the gaps in the documentation, create updated documentation for the top guides
* Create a `cheat sheet` to help contributors new to pull requests and GitHub to help them be able to use our process
* Incorporate feedback from OSPO proffessionals and the wider TODO Community
* Update the documentation on the todogroup.org site, and create a process for updating documentation

For `GOAL 2`, TODO Group will:

* Audit the existing documentation and look for inconcistencies
* Find key areas within the existing documentation to be improved
* Work with PR to make updates and editions to the content
* Build a wishlist of new guidelines needed and create a table of contents (TOC) for each new guideline
* Work with PR to create and refine the new guidelines
* Incorporate feedback from TODO Community
* Update the documentation on the todogroup.org site, and create a process for updating documentation

**ðŸŒ± Benefits to the ecosystem**


* Benefits for the `Contributor community`: Creation of TODO guides will increate TODO resources participation
* Benefits for the `User community`:  Align existing TODO Guides to the most recent OSPO trends will imporve OSPO guidance and roadmap for those organizations willing 
to implement and keep advancing in their OSPO
* Benefits for `Tech Writers`: Tech writers will be able to learn more from OSPOs and contirbute to improve some of the most used and referenced resources used by organizations
willing to run open source program offices and similar initiatives

**ðŸ“ˆ Tracking the Project**

We will track four metrics on a monthly basis:

* Number of guide-tag pull requests opened
* Number of guide-tag succesful merges
* TODO guides visitors growth rate
* TODO guides visitors bounce & retention rate

We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the updated guides:

* The number of new contributors to todogorup.org increases by 10%
* The number of frequent contributors increases by 5%
* The number of visits to todo guides increases by 10%
* The number of visitors to todo guides increases by 5%


**ðŸ•’ Timeline**

The project itself will take approximately six months to complete. Once the tech writer is hired, we'll spend a month on tech writer orientation, then move onto the audit and mind map creation, 
and spend last few months focusing on creating the documentation.
